# Solutions to Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum by Leonard Susskind &amp; Art Friedman (*IN PROGRESS*)

A project to help myself and others to learn basic quantum mechanics from Leonard Susskind's &amp; Art Friedman's book on the theoretical minimum of quantum mechanics. The goal is to be as detailed and style'ish as possible, so that everyone can understand the solutions and the main concepts behind them. The **solutions** are found [here](https://github.com/monoamine11231/Solutions-Quantum-Mechanics-Theoretical-Minimum/blob/master/solutions.pdf).
